			The Anime and Animation Society is an appreciation society for all Japanese (and inspired) media, primarily anime. We want to provide a warm community and a chill space with relaxing and out-there anime. With weekly Anime Screenings and Manga Meet-Ups, we hope to give you a good variety of shows to explore and an opportunity to make new friends and discover all things anime and manga! Now featuring <a href="animation.html"> Animation Events! </a>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong> The student association allows us to include students from outside Edinburgh University, so please feel free to come along if you are studying elsewhere.

			<h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>
			<img class="left" width="300px" src="banshees.jpg">
			<p>
				During semester, we will be meeting for weekly Anime Screenings on Friday evenings on campus. In addition to our regular screenings, we also run a range of other activities throughout the year. In the past, we've done everything from bowling to ice skating to karaoke to bubble tea mixing!
			</p>
			<p>
				Our weekly events are free and open to non-members. However, we greatly appreciate financial support from those who pay the Â£3 membership fee, and some of our irregular events may only be free for members. If you would like to join, you can buy a permanent membership <a href="https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/activities/view/animeandanimation">from our EUSA page</a>.
			</p>

				Please follow our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anisoc.ed/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anisocedinburgh.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> pages for regular updates.

			<h2 id="faq">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Q: &nbsp;Do I need to sign up for screenings?</strong> <br/>
				<strong>A: &nbsp;</strong>No, <u>you do not need to buy a membership</u> or sign up for any of our regular events.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Q: &nbsp;Can we chat during the anime?</strong> <br/>
				<strong>A: &nbsp;</strong>The screenings are fairly casual. There wouldn't be much point to watching anime together if we outlawed jokes and discussion.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Q: &nbsp;Do I have to stay for the full screening?</strong> <br/>
				<strong>A: &nbsp;</strong>No! Feel free leave whenever you want. For example, some people head home after watching the first couple of anime.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Q: &nbsp;Why are you called the Anime <em>and Animation</em> society?</strong> <br/>
				<strong>A: &nbsp;</strong>It's just always been called that. We screened Arcane once.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Q: &nbsp;How old are you?</strong> <br/>
				<strong>A: &nbsp;</strong>As far as we can tell, AASOC had its debut in September of 1999, making us younger than Eva, but older than the legal drinking age.
