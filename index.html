				The Anime and Animation Society is an appreciation society for all Japanese (and inspired) media, primarily anime. We want to provide a warm community and a chill space with relaxing and out-there anime. With weekly Anime Screenings and Manga Meet-Ups, we hope to give you a good variety of shows to explore and an opportunity to make new friends and discover all things anime and manga!
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong> The student association allows us to include students from outside Edinburgh University, so please feel free to come along if you are studying elsewhere.

			<h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>
			<img class="left" width="300px" src="banshees.jpg">
			<p>
				During semester, we meet for weekly Anime Screenings on Tuesdays at the <a href="https://www.thebansheelabyrinth.com/cinema/">Banshee Labyrinth Cinema</a> at 7pm, and for weekly Café Socials on Saturday afternoon. In addition to these regular events, we also run a range of other activities throughout the year. In the past, we've done everything from bowling to ice skating to karaoke to bubble tea mixing!
			</p>
			<p>
				Our weekly events are free and open to non-members. However, we greatly appreciate financial support from those who pay the £2 membership fee, and some of our irregular events may only be free for members. If you would like to join, you can buy a permanent membership <a href="https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/activities/view/animeandanimation">from our EUSA page</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anisoc.ed/">our Instagram page</a> or Discord server for regular updates.

			<h2>CURRENT SCREENINGS</h2>
			<p>
				We select new anime at the start of each semester, so keep an eye out for the chance to vote on your preferences around that time. The Tuesday screening begins at 7pm, when the Banshee Labyrinth opens, and continues as we watch two episodes of each anime, interspersed with breaks for discussion. Feel free to leave after the first couple of anime if you would prefer not to stay for the full length.

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Q: &nbsp;Can we chat during the anime?</strong> <br/>

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Q: &nbsp;Who is Arin?</strong> <br/>
				<strong>A: &nbsp;</strong>The Youkai known as <i>Arin</i> is an elusive spirit who, when sighted, claims to be the ANISOC president and signals oncoming misfortune.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Q: &nbsp;Why are you called the Anime <em>and Animation</em> society?</strong> <br/>
				<strong>A: &nbsp;</strong>It's just always been called that. We screened Arcane once.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Q: &nbsp;How old are you?</strong> <br/>
				<strong>A: &nbsp;</strong>As far as we can tell, AASOC had its debut in September of 1999, making us younger than Eva, but older than the legal drinking age.
