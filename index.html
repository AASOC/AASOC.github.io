			The Anime and Animation Society is an appreciation society for all Japanese (and inspired) media, primarily anime. We want to provide a warm community and a chill space with relaxing and out-there anime. With weekly Anime Screenings and Manga Meet-Ups, we hope to give you a good variety of shows to explore and an opportunity to make new friends and discover all things anime and manga! Now featuring <a href="animation.html"> Animation Events! </a>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong> The student association allows us to include students from outside Edinburgh University, so please feel free to come along if you are studying elsewhere.

			<h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>
			<img class="left" width="300px" src="banshees.jpg">
			<p>
				During semester, we will be meeting for weekly Anime Screenings on Friday evenings on campus, and for monthly Film Screenings at Banshee Labyrinth. In addition to these regular events, we also run a range of other activities throughout the year. In the past, we've done everything from bowling to ice skating to karaoke to bubble tea mixing!
			</p>
			<p>
				Our weekly events are free and open to non-members. However, we greatly appreciate financial support from those who pay the Â£3 membership fee, and some of our irregular events may only be free for members. If you would like to join, you can buy a permanent membership <a href="https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/activities/view/animeandanimation">from our EUSA page</a>.

			<h2 id="faq">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Q: &nbsp;Do I need to sign up for screenings?</strong> <br/>
				<strong>A: &nbsp;</strong>No, <u>you do not need to buy a membership</u> or sign up for any of our regular events.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Q: &nbsp;Can we chat during the anime?</strong> <br/>
				<strong>A: &nbsp;</strong>The screenings are fairly casual. There wouldn't be much point to watching anime together if we outlawed jokes and discussion.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Q: &nbsp;Do I have to stay for the full screening?</strong> <br/>
				<strong>A: &nbsp;</strong>No! Feel free leave whenever you want. For example, some people head home after watching the first couple of anime.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Q: &nbsp;Why are you called the Anime <em>and Animation</em> society?</strong> <br/>
				<strong>A: &nbsp;</strong>It's just always been called that. We screened Arcane once.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Q: &nbsp;How old are you?</strong> <br/>
				<strong>A: &nbsp;</strong>As far as we can tell, AASOC had its debut in September of 1999, making us younger than Eva, but older than the legal drinking age.
